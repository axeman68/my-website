            	<p>Hi and let me say thank for visiting Comfortably-numb-tab.co.uk 
	   I hope you like it,</br>
	   when i started playing Guitar about 10 years ago , being young and broke finding free guitar tab was a joke .
	   I thought i'd try and change that.</br>
	  This site was created to pass the music of Pink floyd to the younger guitar Playing generation . Our tab is
	   all written by myself and is my own interpretation of the song ( it is not copied from a book )and are avalible
	   in a pdf file . Each  file contains parts for each guitar part. example-The wall pt 1 contains two guitar parts 
	   one for the lead Guitar and one for the muted guitar.
                </div>

                <div class="content_right">
               <p>We have included some mp3 tracks to go with the tab. Again they are  all produced in house.</br>
	      And are avalible at the bottom of each page so you can listen listen to them,( These are not avalible for download yet )
	       Again each track is recorded seperatly and is constantly being updated.
	      </br>Video lessons  are also avalible for some songs on our video page , and are played at a lower tempo to aid learning the 
	      track.
	      Why not send me an Email with the embed code for one of your youtube videos playing some floyd and i'll post the best every week on the </br>
		video page .</br>
		Why not request a tab or Video Lesson and I will get one out on site as soon as I can.</br>
		See link at to of page.
